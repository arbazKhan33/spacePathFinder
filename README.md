# spacePathFinder
🚀 A visualization tool utilizing the A* algorithm to navigate through the vast expanse of outer space. Set your starting point (Earth), destination (Target Planet), and watch as the pathfinding algorithm strategically avoids obstacles (Asteroids) to find the quickest route.


Features:

🌍 Interactive UI: Manually set the Earth, Target Planet, and Asteroids.
🪐 Dynamic Pathfinding: Real-time visualization of the A* pathfinding algorithm.
🌌 Customizable Grid Size: Flexible grid configurations to increase or decrease complexity.

How to Use:

Run space_pathfinder.py.
Left-click to set the Earth (start point), Target Planet (end point), and place Asteroids.
Press SPACE to initiate the pathfinding algorithm.
Watch as the spaceship finds its way!
Press 'C' to reset the grid and start anew.
